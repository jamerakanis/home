				This game. To describe the synergy and fluidity of this game is... pretty much impossible. I would never feel like I had done a good job at trying to explain what this game is like. The closest I've gotten is: "Imagine teleporting infinitely," but that doesn't cut it. So I pulled up an article to explain exactly what this game is all about.

				<em>
					"As a stylish rekindling of old-school action games, Hyper Light Drifter lets its basic combat mechanics, and heavily inferred story do all the talking, subduing you in a hypnotic trance of sound and color. While it excels in all of those beautiful, pixelated spaces, it also obscures too many pieces of its time-traveling story for this world of death and savagery to make sense.<br/><br/>Hyper Light Drifter is provocative. In its first impression, it radiates light and warmth and tone through incandescent rays of kaleidoscopic neon graphics, staticy sounds, and upbeat digital tunes that set the stage for a colorful sci-fi world. Its pixel art is brilliant, conveying detail through subtle touches – like a blast of air causing ripples in the water. Despite its pixelated trappings, it grapples with mature themes: extinction, genocide, cultism, religious symbolism, and time travel.<br/><br/>Developer Heart Machine’s slick fighting systems are equally distilled, marrying melee slashes and long-ranged firearms with slippery dashes for a simple, potent foundation. That’s built upon through purchasable skills, which give you the option to add complexity where you want it. For example, precisely timing your dash allows for another, and another, and another, chaining dashes for as long as you’re able to keep the rhythm without running into anything. Similarly, you can upgrade your sword to reflect incoming projectiles back at attackers, perform a dash-lunge, or hold your slash for a powerful, charged AOE swipe in the style of The Legend of Zelda: A Link To the Past.<br/><br/>With the exception of a grenade ability, these upgrades don’t introduce completely new mechanics, but instead only add interesting elements to your beginning skills. That adds flavor to the combat systems without overcomplicating things. But most impressively, they’re all optional – to the point where you can finish Hyper Light Drifter’s roughly seven-hour campaign without purchasing any upgrades at all, if you’ve got the raw skill to pull it off."
