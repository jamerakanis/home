				Hyper Light Drifter is the very essence of 8-bit and 16-bit games, taking place in the post-apocalyptic era of a fictional land full of unreal technology, contouring magic itself. You, a drifter, get an opportunity to explore the world and discover secrets held underground by great evil, under a layer of nature and purity. A gripping story, told by pictures, and read without words. On the edge of your seat throughout, and at the mercy of beauty itself.

				A truly immersive game, a must play, and definitely my game of the year, this monster of a game has shaken me to the core from the very start, without words, but with tale. I finished the game during the summer of 2016, right before vacation. I can confidently say that it was the biggest mistake of my life. For starters, it ruined my vacation, being unable to remove it from my memory, but furthermore, I have been skeptical of playing video games from then on. Nothing can replace Hyper Light Drifter. Other than (I pray for) a sequel, of course.

				<!--Insert site info here.-->				
				I cannot bring myself to play the game again, but it is not something that I will ever forget. I have made this website to bring a dawn of Drifters, and hope to show this game to the world, and promote the making of a Hyper Light Drifter Two. This website has all of my knowledge of Hyper Light Drifter, and everything I found so amazing about the game. Iâ€™ll give you a little summary of what I have: This game has no flaws except its length. This game is as long as an indie, but it is not the indie it is known as.
