				Welcome!
			</h2>
			<p class="subDiv">
				Here, you’ll find Heart Machine’s arsenal of monsters, enemies, cultists, and their acolytes. However, you’ll also find <em>your</em> very own arsenal, to fend off these foul beasts. There are spoilers, so I recommend you use the table of contents on the side, but that is just a recommendation. Lowering your gaze is just as effective, other than the fact that you won’t be able to see much.... Please ignore my terrible jokes and browse as you please!<br/><br/>Please keep in mind that I did not include the final boss in my wiki. I’ll leave that for you to discover, because I really believe that it will shake you if you experience it yourself.

				A Very Vague Overview
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				The world has ended. Well, not exactly ended, but it’s in terrible shape. Titans rose, supposedly created by the angels, but no one knew for what purpose. Wreaking havoc all over the land, civilization is lost. Interestingly, it’s all just a cool story to our protagonist, the Drifter. A sentient being, drifting around. The only thing he may care about is his life. So when it’s in danger, he shows no mercy.<br/><br/>Until he realizes it’s the unmerciful he’s dealing with.
			</p>

				Bosses
			</h2>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="theHangedMan">
					The Hanged Man
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				Definitely a general of war, as implied by his OST The Last General. It may have been during the coming of the titans, that he was martyred and hung as a message of fear. High chance that he’s not normal, he’s lost his mind, he has crystals inside of him, and… he gets crystal beings to follow him. Watch out for the soldiers he can break out of the crystals to help him fight. They are fast, and have incredible poise. They will not back down no matter how much you bash them.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="theHierophant">
					The Hierophant
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A cult leader. For sure. The leader of a rather intelligent race, wearers of vulture masks, summoners of vultures, vulture this, vulture that, etc. Although he may be a bit lacking in the civilization, they definitely have a hierarchy, with him at the top, and then his magicians, also known as the vulture shamans, followed by his army of minions, the vulture acolytes. Cuddly fellows, but cunning, quick, and most importantly, powerful.
			</p>

				<a name="theEmperor">
					The Emperor
				</a>
			</h3>
			<img class="wikiSideImage" src="images/theEmperor.jpg" alt="theEmperor.jpg"/>
			<p class="subDiv">
				The first non-humanoid boss you’ll fight. He is a toad (or a frog) but is not to be underestimated. He is probably the hardest boss you’ll fight, and I say this because he was one of the later bosses I fought, but he was still extremely difficult, despite all the equipment I had obtained, prior to this. Fortunately, he has a very specific pattern of attacks, probably owing to his being a toad (or a frog). Predicting his movements becomes a very simple task after the tenth try at him, which is actually very fast, compared to other bosses. He has toad (or frog) minions which took over a temple in the east, which is where you fight him.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="theArcher">
					The Archer
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				In the final area, there isn’t a boss to end it, but rather multiple bosses, each guarding an artifact, part of the sixteen required to unlock the final chamber. There are three bosses here, guarding three of the artifacts, and a final artifact is hidden in a secret area. The archer is one of the fastest bosses in the entire game, shooting arrows in rapid succession, and throwing his knives and what-not at you. His one weakness, is that being ranged, throwing his things back at him will not be too healthy for him. Most likely being a robot (perhaps implied by the lab factory you fight in), he will point blank you, so don’t try to melee him.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="theReaper">
					The Reaper
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				When you fight him, you may think he’s easy, but after ten minutes or so, realization will dawn on you. He is very stubborn. Some kind of artificial killing machine, made in some lab, refined in some factory, he is literally unstoppable. Spinning a double-ended scythe around, rolling from one corner of the screen to another, you’ll find it difficult to find some, if any, personal space. Very inhuman, even on robot standards. Don’t mess with him… even though it’s a requirement to finish the game….

				<em>"Ah! Check this out! The artifact is right here! Well, what am I waiting for?"</em> PSYCH! This ain’t no petting zoo! You just got WRECKED! This is what went through my head when I activated the supposed ‘artifact’. Turns out that this ‘Sorcerer’ dude stuck his face in the ground and acted like an artifact and then jumped me when I tried to hit the switch. Man, I should’ve known something was up when the door locked behind me, Zelda style. Robots these days are just about as smart as an ostrich, as shown by this ‘Sorcerer’ who happens to be able to control robot birds via ‘magic’. Wow. What a load of dung. This boss happens to be an attention seeking annoy-o-tron and hosts one of those boss fights that are boring and simply stupid. Not gonna waste too much air on him.

				Enemies
			</h2>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="dirk">
					Dirk
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A monster. Not exactly intelligent, but definitely a pain, especially within its herd. Very simple minded, and spends its free time sitting around fidgeting. Not the most interesting thing, but they do have significant strength, and a lot of poise. Best idea is to get them off guard and finish them off with one combo. Watch out for their armed counterparts…
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="vultureAcolyte">
					Vulture Acolyte
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A minion. Perhaps a slave of the great Hierophant, leader of the vulture shamans. Apprentices of magic, they are not even close to their elders, the shaman adepts of magic.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="bladebot">
					Bladebot
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				The most powerful basic enemy. When they come in gangs of two three, or worse, they will give you a beating, no matter what you have. Agile robots of unknown origin, found in a factory of the southern desert. The barren lands. A beautiful sight to see under the high noon sun, covering the depths of darkness.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="plantBeast">
					Plant Beast
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A mutant. Massive in size, and massive in appetite. They emerge from fertile ground, where only Anubis knows what goes on. Probably enslave the plant beastlings that fight alongside them, sacrificing themselves. Why they explode, is not something you should ask me.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="crystalBrute">
					Crystal Brute
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A brute. Just a brute. Stands there, waiting for you to enter his stomach. Definetly hierarcy present somewhere, beacuase nothing else can explain why they stand around doing nothing. Ah, the Hanged Man….

				<a name="aoeSwipe">
					AOE Swipe
				</a>
			</h3>
			<img class="wikiSideImage" src="images/aoeSlash.jpg" alt="aoeSlash.jpg"/>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A very powerful attack, rending everything in its path. A very potent combo when combined with the projectile reflection, you can throw back wave after wave of bullets and explosives, rendering the enemy a pile of bones. Also excellent for increasing damage output per combo, as it can be done after a three hit combo, and instead of doing another three hits, you can fill in the gap with an AOE which does another three hit value of damage.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				<a name="lunge">
					Lunge
				</a>
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				An excellent attack for swarms of fast enemies, such as ninja toads or the likes. When an enemy moves towards you, you can meet him head on by going through him with a lunge, hitting him, but emerging unscathed. Definetly a potent ability, and one the first our Drifter would obtain.
			</p>

			<!--Guns below-->

				<a name="guns">
					Guns
				</a>
			</h2>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				Pistol
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				Something you scavenged off of some dead body. Not the greatest defense, but the fastest gun in the game (no, there is no machine gun) and great for dealing fast accurate damage, as it reloads faster than others, and can shoot off multiple bullets in quick succession. Definitely my gun of preference.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				Railgun
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				A very peculiar gun, of not much use. However, it is the gun with the highest skill cap, and requires immense coordination. A slow, heavy hitter, that goes through anything it blasts, hitting anything behind it. Lining up a shot in a fray is not something one simply does, but if anyone can do it, a teleporting drifter can. 
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				Cannon
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				The weapon of the Hanged Man. It is pretty much as close as you can get to a revolver. It looks small, but shoots practically a meteor at anyone who wants to mess with you. Upgrading it is highly recommended, as it becomes a beefed up pistol. Replacing the pistol, it is a must-take for boss battles, as it produces devastating results, at the pace of a handgun.
			</p>
			<h3 class="loreSubHeading">
				Shotgun
			</h3>
			<p class="subDiv">
				The most popular gun amongst Hyper Light Drifter fans. I don’t exactly know why, but it is potent in a pinch. I believe that it is much more dependent upon circumstances for it to be useful, versus a gun like the pistol, that is useful in all circumstances. Nonetheless, it deals more damage, and has an AOE, rendering it quite efficient at crowd control.
